# PositionStrategy - http://position-strategy.ffab0.com

"PositionStrategy" is a web service which visualizes a corporate performance by beautiful graphic chart.
You can analyze settlement at least from 3 years performances at a glance.
Also, you can compare 2 companies at same time on the same chart. It's really helpful.

This shows you all companies in Japanese market(The first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,  The second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,   Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers) and U.S market(The New York Stock Exchange,  NASDAQ Stock Market).

I created this on October,  2013. This is my first application in my programmer life.
This is awarded the Tokyo Stock Exchange Application Contest.
